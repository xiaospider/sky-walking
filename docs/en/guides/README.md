## For code developer
As a develop, first step, read [Compiling Guide](How-to-build.md). It teaches developer how to build the project in local.

### Project Extensions
SkyWalking project supports many ways to extend existing features. If you are interesting in these ways,
read the following guides.

- [Java agent plugin development guide](Java-Plugin-Development-Guide.md).
This guide helps you to develop SkyWalking agent plugin to support more frameworks. Both open source plugin
and private plugin developer should read this. 
- If you want to build a new probe or plugin in any language, please read [Component library definition and extension](Component-library-settings.md) document.
- [Storage extension development guide](storage-extention.md). Help potential contributors to build a new 
storage implementor besides the official.
- [Customize analysis by oal script](write-oal.md). Guide you to use oal script to make your own metrics available.
- [Source and scope extension for new metrics](source-extension.md). If you want to analysis a new metrics, which SkyWalking
haven't provide. You need to 
add a new receiver rather than choosing [existed receiver](../setup/backend/backend-receivers.md).
At that moment, 
you most likely need to add a new source and scope. This document will teach you how to do.
- [Backend Inventory entity extension](inventory-extension.md). If you want to extend SkyWalking inventory entities, and
want to push upstream back to our Apache OSS repo, please read these principles.

### UI developer
Our UI is constituted by static pages and web container.

- [RocketBot UI](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rocketbot-ui) is SkyWalking primary UI since 6.1 release.
It is built with vue + typescript. You could know more at the rocketbot repository.
- **Web container** source codes are in `apm-webapp` module. This is a just an easy zuul proxy to host
static resources and send GraphQL query requests to backend.
- [Legacy UI repository](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-ui) is still there, but not included
in SkyWalking release, after 6.0.0-GA.

## For release
[Apache Release Guide](How-to-release.md) introduces to the committer team about doing official Apache version release, to avoid 
breaking any Apache rule. Apache license allows everyone to redistribute if you keep our licenses and NOTICE
in your redistribution.
